       //             BACKTRACKING 

//  In bruteforce  we explore all the possible outcomes does not matter 
//  does not matter it leads to an answer or not. We trace the path for an answer, so 
//  then revert it for other possibilities. Answer will come  or not this 
//  will also not known but the possibilities we will watch up.
//  It is called backtracking.
